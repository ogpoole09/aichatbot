# aichatbot
A nice little AI Chatbot I made with the help of OpenAI. All you need to do is setup a free OpenAI API key with your OpenAPI
account, put $5-$10 in you account, because each conversation comes at a price. It's very cheap though, $10 will last you like 
4,000 small conversations. After you link your API Key into: client = OpenAI(api_key="ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE"), it should work!
You will also need to import tkinter and OpenAI using this commands in the terminal:
- pip install tkinter
- pip install openai

# I WILL NOT MAKE AN EXE FILE BECAUSE IT COSTS ME FOR YOU TO USE THE PROGRAM, I DON'T WANT TO BE BROKE.
